# Cryptanalysis and Decryption Assignment
**Course Project - NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology)**

## Project Overview
This repository contains my solution for a cryptography assignment at **NTNU**. The goal of the project was to analyze four different provided ciphertexts, identify the encryption algorithms used for each, and successfully decrypt them to recover the original plaintexts.
## Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`)
* **Cryptography Libraries** (if applicable, e.g., `pycryptodome`)

## Repository Structure
* `analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the analysis, code, and final decrypted results.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.
